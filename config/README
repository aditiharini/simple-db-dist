# To run a benchmark

* First create benchmark data. You can do so via running one of the benchmark*.py files
* Start the child nodes with startChildNode.sh (should be run from root). The single required parameter is the number of nodes.
* Test a query by running a script in the /query_running_scripts directory. To see the query, check the script file.
